  We present spectral light field tomography for multicolor imaging in three dimensions (3D). Building upon light field tomography, our reconstruction network takes clean light field input and generates 3D volumes. Our method uses a Dove prism array and a cylindrical lens array to transform a 3D scene into one-dimensional (1D) projections. The resulting 1D projections are then spectrally dispersed for parallel spectral measurements and reconstructed into volumetric representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our reconstruction approach in both fluorescence and scattering microscopy applications.
