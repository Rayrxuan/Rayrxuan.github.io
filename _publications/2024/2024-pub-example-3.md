  We present squeezed light field microscopy (SLIM), a computational imaging method that enables rapid detection of high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) light signals using only a single, low-format camera sensor area. SLIM pushes the boundaries of 3D optical microscopy, achieving over one thousand volumes per second across a large field of view of 550 μm in diameter and 300 μm in depth. Using SLIM, we demonstrated blood cell velocimetry across the embryonic zebrafish brain and in a free-moving tail exhibiting high-frequency swinging motion.
