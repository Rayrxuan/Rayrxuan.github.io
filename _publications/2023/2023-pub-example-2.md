  We develope a prototype coded-aperture snapshot spectral imaging (HSI) fundus camera designed for clinical retinal imaging applications, incorporating a robust deep learning-based reconstruction method. The snapshot HSI fundus camera was demonstrated in in vivo retinal autofluorescence imaging of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Beyond its utility for AMD, HSI has also proven effective in identifying spectral biomarkers associated with other neurodegenerative conditions.
