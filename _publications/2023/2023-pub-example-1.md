  We develope a novel two-stage cascaded compressed sensing scheme. By appropriately distributing the computation load to each stage, this method utilizes the compressibility of natural scenes in multiple domains, reducing the ill-posed nature of datacube recovery and achieving enhanced spatial resolution, suppressed aliasing artifacts, and improved spectral fidelity. Our approach efficiently records a five-dimensional (5D) plenoptic function in a single snapshot.
