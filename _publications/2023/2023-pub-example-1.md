  We develop a reconstruction network that takes clean light field input and generates 3D volumes through hyperspectral light field tomography. This method utilizes the compressibility of natural scenes to enable datacube recovery with enhanced spatial resolution and improved spectral fidelity. Our approach efficiently reconstructs a five-dimensional (5D) plenoptic function from clean light field measurements into 3D volumetric representations.
